__Title:__ Pausing to take a deeper look at assumptions

__Abstract:__ Assumptions are a necessary part of statistical modeling and making inferences.  Formal training in Statistics tends to encourage a very mathematical treatment of assumptions, with relatively low expectations for justifying the reasonableness of assumptions or adequately conveying the extent to which conclusions are conditional on assumptions.  Given that statistical inferences are often used to support scientific inferences and decision-making, it is important to acknowledge the conditional aspect of results, as well as take time to pause and more deeply consider the layers of assumptions that make up the foundation of an analysis.  I believe statisticians have a responsibility to better convey the conditional nature of results, and to work with subject matter experts to translate and interrogate assumptions within a particular scientific context.  This is a serious scientific challenge with huge implications in terms of understanding and conveying appropriate use of, and trust in, statistical results.  The goal of this high-level talk is to increase (or re-highlight) awareness and spur discussion about related challenges and strategies.

__Title:__ A case-control sampling strategy for zero-inflated models with an application to female sex worker mapping in sub-Saharan Africa

__Abstract:__ In this work, we propose a subsampling procedure to decrease computation time of zero-inflated models. Zero-inflated models are increasing in popularity and are vital to a variety of applications and disciplines. Performing variable selection, estimating parameters, and diagnosing model fit for zero-inflated models is often prohibitively slow, especially for large data sets and Bayesian models. We show that we can consistently estimate the intercept and slope parameters of both the zero and conditional models. Performance is evaluated using a spatial presence-only data set related to the number of female sex workers in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
