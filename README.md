Megan Dailey Higgs, Critical Inference. 

__Title:__ Pausing to take a deeper look at assumptions

__Abstract:__ Assumptions are a necessary part of statistical modeling and making inferences.  Formal training in Statistics tends to encourage a very mathematical treatment of assumptions, with relatively low expectations for justifying the reasonableness of assumptions or adequately conveying the extent to which conclusions are conditional on assumptions.  Given that statistical inferences are often used to support scientific inferences and decision-making, it is important to acknowledge the conditional aspect of results, as well as take time to pause and more deeply consider the layers of assumptions that make up the foundation of an analysis.  I believe statisticians have a responsibility to better convey the conditional nature of results, and to work with subject matter experts to translate and interrogate assumptions within a particular scientific context.  This is a serious scientific challenge with huge implications in terms of understanding and conveying appropriate use of, and trust in, statistical results.  The goal of this high-level talk is to increase (or re-highlight) awareness and spur discussion about related challenges and strategies.

__Title:__ A case-control sampling strategy for zero-inflated models with an application to female sex worker mapping in sub-Saharan Africa

__Abstract:__ In this work, we propose a subsampling procedure to decrease computation time of zero-inflated models. Zero-inflated models are increasing in popularity and are vital to a variety of applications and disciplines. Performing variable selection, estimating parameters, and diagnosing model fit for zero-inflated models is often prohibitively slow, especially for large data sets and Bayesian models. We show that we can consistently estimate the intercept and slope parameters of both the zero and conditional models. Performance is evaluated using a spatial presence-only data set related to the number of female sex workers in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

__Title:__ Predicting Carbon in Forest Ecosystems: A Case for Process-based Modeling Approaches

__Abstract:__ Approaches to prediction and forecasting in ecological applications broadly fall into three  categories: time-series approaches, space-for-time approaches, and process-based modeling approaches. Empirical statistical models built using time-series and space-for-time approaches may be limited in what type of dynamics they are able to capture: i.e. time-series approaches may accurately capture the dynamics of short term processes and drivers, but can miss out on capturing dynamics of long term processes that are occurring on the order of decades to centuries. Process-based models, on the other hand, are mathematical representations of the processes that govern a system. These models combine our knowledge of the biological processes of the system with statistical tools for uncertainty quantification. In theory, process-based models are able to capture dynamics across all time-scales, and will lead to better forecasts and predictions over any horizon. In practice there are many difficulties, including overparameterization and identifiability, enforcing constraints of the underlying system in a statistically coherent manner, and finding suitable fitting methods. We examine these difficulties and provide possible solutions through the lens of a case study: predicting Leaf Area Index at the University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center.

__Title:__The Genomic Evolution of Living Fossils


__Abstract:__ Most animals have changed radically over the past hundreds of millions of years, yet a few species have remained relatively static. Charles Darwin called these ancient-looking creatures living fossils. Perhaps the most mesmerizing, the fish coelacanths off the eastern coast of Africa and Indonesia morphologically look like fossils as old as 300 million years ago. Genomes of several living fossils were sequenced recently, revealing the low average evolutionary rates of their protein-coding DNA sequences. This level of stasis yearns for a special explanation. How could some animal genomes evolve slowly despite continual environmental change? We are currently unraveling this question with statistical models. Knowing what controls living fossils’ pace of genomic evolution is critical for protecting them from today’s unprecedented climate change and predicting other vulnerable animals.
